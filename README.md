# Accidental_Tourist
## Purpose 
Traffic accidents was chosen as our team topic. We are curous to see how much affect Covid had on traffic accidents across the country.  We saw data stored at Kaggle.com and realized that we had a good source of data to investigate the Covid affect on traffic accidents. The data covers US Accidents from February 2016 through December 2021. This countrywide dataset covers 49 states of the USA using multiple API's (Application Programming Interface) that provide data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks.  There are 2.8 million accident records in this dataset. We may even investigate to see if weather had an additional impact on these accidents.
